# Deep Dive Into Python (2,3)

I wanted to get back into Python coding, and I still think Pilgrim's tutorials are the best introduction I've seen. I suspect he came from a PERL background, as his coding is much more succinct and "real world" than other tutorials I've read. That's the element I wanted to capture.

However, there's a snag - they're really out-of-date. And you have to read the Python 2 tutorial because that's where he gives the best examples (the 3 tutorial is more like an addendum).

So I thought it would be a good exercise to take the version 2 code and re-write it (where possible) in the latest Python 3 dialect.

The applications are:
fileinfodriver.py
dialect.py
plurals.py
romantest.py
file_stats.py
odbchelper.py
apihelper.py
fib.py
decorator.py
